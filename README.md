game sequence:
1. Pick your first pet (Gacha?) "strategy"
2. 


 -- 1 pet
 -- 3 -- dungeon, work, shop
  	 fight for loot, work for money, shop for upgrades
	 "loot" is just more money than work, but you have risk of dying, which is particularly unhelpful. given you lose.

goal is to reach 10000 money and buy a gold crown for your pet

if pet not strong, you can "pull" for a new pet, but your old one is lost forever

you are exchanging the soul of your pet

ALCHEMYYYYYYY

gacha()
 -- new pet, new stats
for 1000 gold
having stronger pet means faster gold gain

you can go to endlessmode
which has a infinite scaling -- simply have a formula to increase difficulty

then

score is money at end of 300 days. if you reach 300 days and have not yet gotten golden crown, then you simply lose immediately


shop - 2 options -- 1. buy accessories -- minor stat buffs for like minimal cost
only one accessory at a time

2. stat upgrades - which scale with number of purchases - so it is better to upgrade an already strong pet
